# HTPC_Scripts
Easing the HTPC pains.

A few scripts I've come up with to make batch-conversions & renaming easier for handling by my media-mangers on my HTPC.

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK; MANY ASSUMPTIONS WERE MADE THOUGH I'M WORKING ON TRYING TO MAKE THEM MORE GENERIC/GENERAL PURPOSE

Both ffconv and concat REQUIRE ffmpeg installed; and concat needs ffmpeg concatenation built in as well.
