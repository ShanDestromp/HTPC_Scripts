# HTPC_Scripts
Easing the HTPC pains.

A few scripts I've come up with to make batch-conversions & renaming easier for handling by my media-mangers on my HTPC.

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK; MANY ASSUMPTIONS WERE MADE THOUGH I'M WORKING ON TRYING TO MAKE THEM MORE GENERIC/GENERAL PURPOSE

Both ffconv and concat REQUIRE ffmpeg installed; and concat needs ffmpeg concatenation built in as well.

whisp utilizes the whisper AI; however it has only been tested with https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper and assumes a NVIDIA gpu for use.
